config NFC_PN533
	tristate "NXP PN533 USB driver"
	depends on USB
	help
	  NXP PN533 USB driver.
	  This driver provides support for NFC NXP PN533 devices.

	  Say Y here to compile support for PN533 devices into the
	  kernel or say M to compile it as module (pn533).

config NFC_WILINK
	tristate "Texas Instruments NFC WiLink driver"
	depends on TI_ST && NFC_NCI
	help
	  This enables the NFC driver for Texas Instrument's BT/FM/GPS/NFC
	  combo devices. This makes use of shared transport line discipline
	  core driver to communicate with the NFC core of the combo chip.

	  Say Y here to compile support for Texas Instrument's NFC WiLink driver
	  into the kernel or say M to compile it as module.

config NFC_MEI_PHY
	tristate "MEI bus NFC device support"
	depends on INTEL_MEI && NFC_HCI
	help
	  This adds support to use an mei bus nfc device. Select this if you
	  will use an HCI NFC driver for an NFC chip connected behind an
	  Intel's Management Engine chip.

	  If unsure, say N.

config NFC_QNCI
	bool "Qualcomm NCI based NFC Controller Driver for qca199x"
	depends on I2C
	select CRC_CCITT
	help
	  This enables the NFC driver for QCA199x based devices.
	  This is for i2c connected version. NCI protocol logic
	  resides in the usermode and it has no other NFC dependencies.

config NFC_NQ
	bool "Qualcomm NCI based NFC Controller Driver for NQx"
	depends on I2C
	select CRC_CCITT
	help
	  This enables the NFC driver for NQx based devices.
	  This is for i2c connected version. NCI protocol logic
	  resides in the usermode and it has no other NFC dependencies.


menuconfig NFC_DEVICES
	bool "Near Field Communication (NFC) devices"
	default n
	---help---
	  You'll have to say Y if your computer contains an NFC device that
	  you want to use under Linux.

	  You can say N here if you don't have any Near Field Communication
	  devices connected to your computer.

	select CRC_CCITT
	default n
	---help---
	  Say yes if you want cxd224x Near Field Communication driver.
	  This is for i2c connected version. If unsure, say N here.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose m here. The module will
	  be called cxd224x-i2c.

config CXD224X_NFC_VEN
	tristate "CXD224X NFC VEN"
	depends on CXD224X_NFC
	default n
	---help---
	  Say yes if you want to use cxd224x NFC VEN(enable voltage) control.
	  If unsure, say N here.

config CXD224X_NFC_RST
	tristate "CXD224X NFC RST"
	depends on CXD224X_NFC
	default y
	---help---
	  Say yes if you want to use cxd224x NFC RST(external XRST pin) control.
